Husky here! I'm a MSML student at CMU. Throughout my research journey, I've explored a variety of topics. Currently, my primary focus is on generative world modeling,  where I have been fortunate to work closely with Professor [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and Professor [Yilun Du](https://yilundu.github.io/) on advancing the capabilities of world models. Previously, I collaborated with my amazing advisor [Jiaqi W. Ma](https://jiaqima.github.io/) at the [TRAIS Lab](https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab), focusing on dataset curation using LLM agents. I also gained valuable research experience in AI interpretability under Professor [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/)'s [XAI Lab](https://sjtu-xai-lab.github.io/).","Within world modeling, I'm particularly(currently) interested in the following directions: \n - How can we enable world models to operate effectively in **long-sequence scenarios**? This includes both looking ahead (simulating long trajectories) and looking back (designing effective memory mechanisms).\n - How can we make world models **real-time interactive**? This is especially crucial for real world applications, and I find both the mathematical and ML systems perspectives fascinating.\n - How can we make world models more **physically grounded**? I'm excited to explore data-driven approaches, RLHF, and other emerging methods."],"avatar":"/avatar.png","professions":[{"name":"Locus","url":"https://github.com/locuslab"},{"name":"MAITRIX","url":"https://maitrix.org/"},{"name":"TRAIS","url":"https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab"}],"tocMaxDepth":2,"excerptMaxLength":50,"birthday":"","location":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","email":"","postsForArchivePage":3,"social":[{"url":"/resume.pdf","icon":["ai","cv"]},{"url":"https://github.com/huskydoge","icon":["fab","github"]},{"url":"https://twitter.com/intent/follow?&region=follow_link&screen_name=huskydogewoof","icon":["fab","twitter"]},{"url":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SiAFHb8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN","icon":["fa","graduation-cap"]},{"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benhao-h-6534b629a/","icon":["fab","linkedin"]},{"url":"mailto:hbh001098hbh@sjtu.edu.cn","icon":["fas","envelope"]}],"disqusScript":"https://tc-imba.disqus.com/embed.js","contactFormUrl":"https://getform.io/f/09a3066f-c638-40db-ad59-05e4ed71e451","pages":{"home":"/","posts":"posts","contact":"contact","resume":"resume","tags":"tags","research":"research","project":"project"},"wakatime":{"username":"tcimba","activity":"7add4047-08f9-4da8-b649-aa114503678f","language":"460a84ab-722a-4b80-b896-cabaa13ad7eb","editor":"d851639a-28d8-4884-949f-d338a858f7e9","os":"caf7d0d1-8fd2-4595-a991-363c8583fea9"},"interests":[{"icon":["fas","brain"],"title":"World Model, Reasoning and Planning"},{"icon":["fas","cubes"],"title":"Data-centric AI, AI Automation"},{"icon":["fas","layer-group"],"title":"Efficient ML, Long Sequence Modeling"}],"education":[{"date":"Aug 2025 - Feb 2027 (expected)","icon":["fas","university"],"title":"M.S. in Machine Learning","location":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"date":"Sept 2021 - July 2025","icon":["fas","university"],"title":"B.S.E. in Computer Science","location":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"date":"Sept 2018 - June 2021","icon":["fas","school"],"title":"High School","location":"Zhejiang Ruian High School"}],"experience":[{"title":"Internship","position":"left","data":[{"date":"Mar. 2025 - Aug. 2025","title":"[VCG Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/), Harvard","location":"Cambridge, MA, USA","description":""},{"date":"Jun. 2024 - Mar. 2025","title":"[Maitrix.org](https://github.com/maitrix-org), UCSD","location":"San Diego, CA, USA","description":null},{"date":"Mar. 2024 - Jun. 2024","title":"Research Intern @ [Moonshot AI](https://www.moonshot.cn/)","location":"remote","description":null},{"date":"Nov. 2023 - Sept. 2024","title":"[TRAIS Lab](https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab), UIUC","location":"remote","description":null},{"date":"Feb. 2023 - Jan. 2024","title":"[XAI Lab](https://sjtu-xai-lab.github.io/), SJTU","location":"Shanghai, China","description":null}]},{"title":"Teaching & Tutoring","position":"right","data":[{"date":"June 2024","title":" Group Tutor of Advanced Mathematics","location":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China","description":null},{"date":"Dec 2023","title":"Personal Tutor of CS2612, Programming Languages and Compilers ","location":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China","description":null}]},{"title":"Volunteer","position":"left","data":[{"date":"2022 ~ 2024","title":"Volunteer of Shanghai Marathon","location":"Shanghai, China","description":null}]}],"awards":[{"date":"2024","title":"National Scholarship","show":true},{"date":"2023","title":"Rui Yuan Hong Shan Scholarship (Top 2%, SJTU)","show":false},{"date":"2022","title":"Shao Qiu Scholarship (Top 4%, SJTU)","show":false},{"date":"2022","title":"Meritorious Winner of MCM/ICM","show":false}],"tags":[{"id":"javascript","name":"javascript","description":"JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language used alongside HTML and CSS to give functionality to web pages.","color":"#f0da50"},{"id":"nodejs","name":"Node.js","description":"Node.js is a tool for executing JavaScript in a variety of environments.","color":"#90c53f"},{"id":"rxjs","name":"RxJS","description":"RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, for asynchronous operations.","color":"#eb428e"},{"id":"typescript","name":"typescript","description":"TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.","color":"#257acc"},{"id":"reactjs","name":"reactjs","description":"React is an open source JavaScript library used for designing user interfaces.","color":"#61dbfa"},{"id":"gatsby","name":"Gatsby.js","description":"A framework built over ReactJS to generate static page web application.
