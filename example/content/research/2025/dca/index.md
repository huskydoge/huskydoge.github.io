It’s a pity that I won’t be able to attend KDD 2025 due to visa issues. My amazing mentor [Jiaqi W. Ma](https://jiaqima.github.io/) and co-author [Xingjian Zhang](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/xingjian-zhang) will be there on our behalf.

** 08/05/2025 Update: **

- I’m happy to hear that DCA-Bench received a total of six questions during the oral session. Surprisingly, the session chair showed great interest in our work—haha!
