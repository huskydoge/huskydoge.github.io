Husky here! I'm an incoming student in the CMU MSML program. Throughout my research journey, I've explored a variety of topics. Currently, my primary focus is on generative world modeling, where I have been working with Professor [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) on World Model Projects. Prior to this, I collaborated with my amazing supervisor [Jiaqi W. Ma](https://jiaqima.github.io/) at the [TRAIS Lab](https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab), focusing on dataset curation using LLM agents. I also had a valuable research experience in AI interpretability at Professor [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/)'s [XAI Lab](https://sjtu-xai-lab.github.io/).\",\n-    \n-    \"Within world modeling, I'm particularly(currently) interested in the following directions: \\n - How can we enable world models to operate effectively in **long-sequence scenarios**? This includes both looking ahead (simulating long trajectories) and looking back (designing effective memory mechanisms).\\n - How can we make world models **real-time interactive**? This is especially crucial for real world applications, and I find both the mathematical and ML systems perspectives fascinating.\\n - How can we make world models more **physically grounded**? I'm excited to explore data-driven approaches, RLHF, and other emerging methods.\",\n-    \n-    \"If you're also passionate about these areas, feel free to reach out! I'm always open to collaborations and eager to gain more experience along the way. \"\n-  ],\n-  avatar: \"/avatar.png\",\n-  professions: [\n-    {\n-      name: \"MAITRIX\",\n-      url: \"https://maitrix.org/\" \n-    },\n-    {\n-      name: \"TRAIS\",\n-      url: \"https://github.com/TRAIS-Lab\"\n-    },\n-    {\n-      name: \"SJTU-XAI\",\n-      url: \"https://sjtu-xai-lab.github.io/\"\n-    },\n-  ],\n-  tocMaxDepth: 2,\n-  excerptMaxLength: 50,\n-  // birthday: \"xxxx\",\n-  location: \"Shanghai, China\",\n-  // email: \"huskydogewoof@gmail.com\",\n-  postsForArchivePage: 3,\n-  defaultLanguage: \"en\",\n-  disqusScript:\n-    process.env.DISQUS_SCRIPT || \"https://tc-imba.disqus.com/embed.js\",\n-  pages: {\n-    home: \"/\",\n-    posts: \"posts\",\n-    contact: \"contact\",\n-    resume: \"resume\",\n-    tags: \"tags\",\n-    research: \"research\",\n-    project: \"project\",\n-    contact: \"contact\",\n-  },\n-  social: [\n-    {\n-      url: \"/resume.pdf\",\n-      icon: [\"ai\", \"cv\"],\n-    },\n-    {\n-      url: \"https://github.com/huskydoge\",\n-      icon: [\"fab\", \"github\"],\n-    },\n-    {\n-      url: \"https://x.com/huskydogewoof\",\n-      icon: [\"fab\", \"twitter\"],\n-    },\n-    {\n-      url: \"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SiAFHb8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN\",\n-      icon: [\"fa\", \"graduation-cap\"],\n-    },\n-    {\n-      url: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benhao-h-6534b629a/\",\n-      icon: [\"fab\", \"linkedin\"],\n-    },\n-    {\n-      url: \"mailto:hbh001098hbh@sjtu.edu.cn\",\n-      icon: \"envelope\",\n-    },\n-  ],\n-  // facebook: 'https://www.facebook.com/rolwin.monteiro',\n-  // instagram: 'https://www.instagram.com/reevan100/',\n-  // rss: '/rss.xml',\n-  wakatime: {\n-    username: \"tcimba\",\n-    activity: \"7add4047-08f9-4da8-b649-aa114503678f\",\n-    language: \"460a84ab-722a-4b80-b896-cabaa13ad7eb\",\n-    editor: \"d851639a-28d8-4884-949f-d338a858f7e9\",\n-    os: \"caf7d0d1-8fd2-4595-a991-363c8583fea9\",\n-  },\n-  contactFormUrl:\n-    process.env.CONTACT_FORM_ENDPOINT ||\n-    \"https://getform.io/f/09a3066f-c638-40db-ad59-05e4ed71e451\",\n-  googleAnalyticTrackingId: process.env.GA_TRACKING_ID || \"G-ZK3P43DY6M\",\n-  education: [\n-    {\n-      date: \"Aug 2025 -
